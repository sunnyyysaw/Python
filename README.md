# Python
This repository contains Python scripts and datasets that document my data science journey. 
It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) scripts for understanding data, feature engineering code for creating meaningful variables, and various datasets used along the way. 
The repository serves as a comprehensive collection of practical work demonstrating key steps in data preparation, analysis, and modeling. 
It is regularly updated with new scripts and resources as the project evolves, providing an organized and accessible archive of my learning and experimentation in the field of data science.

Each Python file is organized and documented to make it easy to follow the workflow. This repository is ideal for anyone interested in data science, machine learning, and practical applications of Python for data analysis.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute.
